I did not choose the Unreal-Marketplace, because it is still not possible to buy stuff from there and download it to Linux)\r\n-    Installing different versions of Unreal Engine\r\n-    Loading projects from the Launcher\r\n-    Start in OpenGl4 mode\r\n-    Start in OpenGl3 mode (when openGL4 is disabled)\r\n-   Start with Primus-run enabled (for Nvidia + Intel hybrid graphic solutions)\r\n-    Disable webpage loading on start (disabled by default, for enabling, enable \"stream\")\r\n-   Change Installation procedure to other distribution (ATM: Ubuntu, Mint, Arch)\r\n-    Changing all the commands, which will be executed when installing the engine\r\n-    Change the distribution specific commands\r\n-    Last but not least: Save all options into a readable .conf file in the the main directory of the launcher\r\n-    Create Desktop-File etc. from \"Install.sh (see installation below)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings I want to do in the future\r\n\r\n-    get Vulkan working with the engine (you actually can try to enable Vulkan in the preferences menu, this will add the -vulkan option to the start-command. However, it does not start correctly on my system, but maybe I installed Vulkan the wrong way)\r\n-    Add an option to make backups from project-folders, as well as restoring them\r\n-    Add a small tool for combining one-channel Textures like hight-maps with three channel Textures like albedo-maps\r\n-    Add a small tool for adding pre-made project-files (like base materials and blueprints) to existing new projects\r\n-    to be continued \r\n\r\n\r\n**Installation:**\r\n\r\nUbuntu/Mint: download .deb from the master branch and double klick the file!\r\n\r\nArch: Download the .tar.xz file from the master branch and install it via packman with `sudo pacman -U *filename*`\r\n\r\nfor more Information, please visit the [forum-post](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?110795-Beta-Launcher-for-Linux&p=532928#post532928) on the Unreal forum!\r\n\r\n\r\n[further information:]\r\n\r\nDistribution I am writing on : Arch Linux\r\nStarted:  around Easter 2016\r\nsoftware needed to run: GTK 3.10+ , WebKit (PyWebKit), Python 3, Vte 2.91+ \r\n\r\n[Note about me:]\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind that I learn Python since fall 2015, so the code will be far from perfect.\r\nIf you have questions feel free to contact me at siebencorgie@googlemail.com \r\n\r\n",
